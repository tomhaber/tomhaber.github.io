abstract: We present an approach for recovering the reflectance of a static scene with known geometry from a collection of images taken under distant, unknown illumination. In contrast to previous work, we allow the illumination to vary between the images, which greatly increases the applicability of the approach. Using an all-frequency relighting framework based on wavelets, we are able to simultaneously estimate the per-image incident illumination and the per-surface point reflectance. The wavelet framework allows for incorporating various reflection models. We demonstrate the quality of our results for synthetic test cases as well as for several datasets captured under laboratory conditions. Combined with multi-view stereo reconstruction, we are even able to recover the geometry and reflectance of a scene solely using images collected from the Internet.
